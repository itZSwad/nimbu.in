-! # The Web Experience

-! # Our View of the Web Experience
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nimbublips/blackbox-dev.svg)

-! # Creating inferior experience
-! # "Why does the page flicker?"
-! #"Why  is my page so slow when scrolling?"

-! # Leads to Superstitions

-! ## "Use `translate3d(0, 0, 0)` to make your scrolling/animations faster"

-! ## "Use longer decimal units to make browsers be more accurate about % values"

-! ## What is a browser?

-! ## How do the pixels render?

-! ## Layout/Reflow
Calculation of information required to display visible DOM nodes.

-! ## When does it happen?
- Style changes
- Fetching of layout values/scroll values [Demo](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/rendering/too-much-layout.html) [Fixed Demo](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/rendering/too-much-layout-fixed.html)
- Adding/removing elements


-! ## How to detect?
[Demo](http://codepen.io/nimbupani/full/nkbfC)

-! ## Avoid it like a plague

-! ## How to minimize Layout?
- Move content away from the flow. [Demo](/layout.html)
- Use only on the element with least children.
- Batch reading/writing [layout values](http://gent.ilcore.com/2011/03/how-not-to-trigger-layout-in-webkit.html)
- Apply layout changes on `requestAnimationFrame`

-! ## `requestAnimationFrame`

-! ## Frame?

-! ## Framerate

-!## 60fps

-! ## new frame every 16.67ms
-! ## `setInterval`, `setTimeout`
[Drops frames if it is not synced to Browser refresh rate.](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/rendering/raf-motivation.html)

-! ## Minimize Style Changes
-! ### Avoid
- Sibling Selectors
- Generic Selectors

-! ### Use
- Specific classes (optimized)

-! ## Paints
Browser changes the pixel values of an area of the viewport

-! ## When does it happen?
- Scrolling
- Hover, Mouse moves
- Anything and everything

-! ## Typical Painting

-! ### Go through Stacking contexts

-! ## Stacking Contexts?!
- Root Object (html)
- `transform`, `position: relative`, `position: absolute`
- opacity < 1
- CSS Filter
- overflow is set

-! ### Create Render Layers

-! ## Render Layers
- Each Stacking context creates a Render Layer
- WebGL has own Render Layer
- So does Video or Accelerated Canvas Element

-! ## Paint to a Bitmap
- One Bitmap

-! ## Hardware Acceleration!
- 
- Each Bitmap renders a bunch of Render Layers

-! # How does a browser decide to create a new bitmap??
- Painting intensive elements (video, canvas)
- 3D Transformed elements
- Filters, masks, reflections, opacity, transitions, animations
- `position: fixed`
- Content overlapping existing Bitmap textures

-! ## How do you know how many bitmaps?
[Demo](http://www.html5rocks.com/static/demos/movikantirevo/build4.html)

-! ## Some bitmaps handled by GPU

-! ## GPU?!

![](http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/14200000/CS-source-wallpaper-counter-strike-14231626-1024-768.jpg)
(RenderLayer, RenderTree display on Nightly WebKit)

-! ## Like CPU but optimized for processing large blocks of data in parallel

-! ## GPU controls rendering of all bitmaps it is responsible for
- No Repaints, relayouts [Demo]
- Tiles to render only small areas of texture
- Larger power consumption

-! ### Which is why sometimes content suddenly turned into a GPU-rendered bitmap flicker
-! ### Or when GPU is trying to paint new textures in tiles.

-! ### Sometimes fonts look terrible

-! ## GPU reduces burden on CPU

-! ## Limited by Memory
- Each backing store uses dimension of texture * 4 bytes
- Retina will be 4x
- Retina zoom will be 16x


-! ## Memory?
RAM where Browser stores data, including textures that GPU works on

-! ## Memory on Devices vs Memory on Desktop
- Android & iOS can force quit Safari or WebView App to free memory
- More apps open, the smaller the size of memory available to your page

-! ## How to reduce memory usage?!
- Smaller images (remember, images are dimensions * 4 bytes for each pixel)
- Lesser DOM objects
- Lesser GPU layers
- Smaller textures to the GPU

-! ## Reduce CPU/GPU switching
- Do animations only in HW layer [Demo](http://codepen.io/nimbupani/pen/GCxIn)
- Don't animate z-index
- Use Opacity to toggle visibility of GPU-accelerated content

-! ### Why Opacity?
- Textures still in GPU

-! ### How about `visibility:hidden`
- Removes textures from GPU (flickrs happen when CPU rendering switches to GPU)

-! ### `display: none'?
- Lead to repaints

-! ### Remove element from the DOM?
- Worst performance
- Fire events
- Calculate new set of elements that match `nth-child` or `odd` or `even` or sibling selectors
- Layout & Repaint

-! ## In Summary
- Rendering is a beat
- Use specific class names
- Change layout sparingly
- Use CPU to repaint sparingly
- Use GPU acceleration where possible
- But be careful of memory size
- Test! Test! Test!
